                <p>I’m an aspiring full stack developer who loves building applications! When I first started programming, what drew me in immediately was seeing every line of code build towards something that I envisioned in my mind. Since those days, I’ve spent my time learning as much as I can to enable me to build cooler and cooler things! I want to use what I’ve learned to make things that I can share with the world. Check out my Github for some of the projects I've worked on!</p>
                <br />
                <p>In my free time, when I’m not coding or studying, I love exploring and hiking. Having grown up in suburban Ohio, I’m constantly in awe of northern California’s natural beauty and the vibrant city of San Francisco. In addition, I enjoy cooking and making different dishes. Recently, I’ve been learning to make sushi!</p>

                        <p>At DocuSign, I developed responsive, high visibility webpages. With my work, I converted thousands of pageviews into conference registrations.</p><br />
                        <p>In addition, I was responsible for pioneering a React library in preparation for a website redesign. Using stateless, functional design principles, I designed and developed reusable components. This improved page load by 16 times, as the CSS was modularized!</p><br />
                        <p>I also was responsible for independently developing a proof of concept of the new website. Using Spring Boot, a RESTful API Java framework, the React library I developed, and Drupal 8 as a content management system, I presented a demo to senior project and product managers. By decoupling the CMS from the frontend, it allowed our data to be served to other teams.</p>

                        <p>In my third summer at TMW Systems, I was responsible for completing a project I had begun the summer prior. Using Selenium, I developed an automated UI testing framework for TMW's web product that replaced quarterly week-long UI testing sessions with nightly automated tests.</p><br />
                        <p>After completing the testing framework, I began a new project, developing a comprehensive set of unit tests and user documentation for TMW System's API product. By mocking data, my tests allowed for decoupled testing from the database, improving speed and efficiency of builds.</p>

                        <p>I began development of the aforementioned automated UI testing framework. Working closely with my manager, we researched and tested many different automated framework solutions, including F#, before settling on developing a Selenium testing framework that ran on a instance of the Web Product in a headless Chrome browser every night on a Linux server.</p><br />
                        <p>After resources were allocated, namely a dedicated server, I began development on the tests themselves, building suites of tests for each page.</p>

                    <p>My role on the team was not only lead developer, but also team leader. After bringing the team together, I'm also responsible for holding my teammates accountable, as well as enabling our project manager to do her job in implementing Agile development practices. I also developed our business model and decided the core features for our app.</p>

                        <p>Insight was a project developed for Berkeley's User Interfaces course. My team and I developed wireframes, prototypes, dark horses, and a live demo, all the while using methods used in class to develop an intuitive user experience. Insight was developed with Node.JS and Bootstrap with integration to Twilio.</p><br />
                        <p>The context of our project was to develop an application to break echo chambers on the internet, found when people use social media and read the news. Our solution was to enable users, after reading a news article, to discuss it's content with another user on the opposite end of the political spectrum, either over chat or over videocam.</p>

                        <p>Spotifind was born from an incomplete hackathon project. With Spotify API integration, Spotifind enabled users to discover and contribute to geotagged playlists. It was developed with a .NET RESTful API connected to MSSQL and an HTML and SCSS web frontend.</p><br />
                        <p>After completion, Spotifind was deployed to Azure and populated with a database of playlists using a places database found online.</p>
